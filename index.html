<h2> Interests and Hobbies</h2>
<p>I would call myself a gamer. I've been a gamer ever since I was a child. My starting game was<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted_(2005_video_game)"> Need for Speed: Most Wanted.</a> As I grew older I became interested in various other genres of video games such as: First-person shooters, Open-World, and RPG games. As I became more interested I started watching gaming youtubers such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/M3RKMUS1C">M3rkmus1c.</a> Gaming will always be a passion of mine and something I use to relax and wind down at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I'm also a massive book reader. I've always been a bit of a nerd. I love<a href="http://www.dccomics.com/characters/batman"> Batman and DC Comics. </a> I love to read the Batman comic books and graphic novels and learn more about the character. I have a habit of collecting the graphic novels and usually try to place them on my bookshelf on chronological order.</p>
